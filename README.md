# Madnet/Bridge

This repository contains all solidity smart contracts used by the MadNet.

## Requirements

### Dapp tools

To build and deploy the contracts, we use a command line tool called **dapp
tools**. Check the [official dapptools
documentation](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation) for
instructions on how to install it.

Note: You will need to install Nix in order to install the **dapp tools**.

### HardHat

To install hardhat and all requirements to compile and test the smart contracts in this repository,
run the following command at the root of this repository:

```bash
npm install
```

In addition to this, we also suggest the installation of the [hardhat short hand
extension](https://hardhat.org/guides/shorthand.html):

```bash
npm i -g hardhat-shorthand
```

Now to compile the contracts, run:

```bash
